## 🔐 How I Finally Understood Spring Security (and You Can Too)

A developer’s journey to making sense of Spring Security’s core components — explained clearly with real-world examples.

Spring Security has a reputation: powerful but confusing.

I’ve been working as a Java/Kotlin Software Engineer using Spring Boot for several years. And yet — despite regularly
working with it — **Spring Security always felt intimidating**.

It seemed overly complex, with so many moving parts and unfamiliar terms:
➡️ Filters, FilterChain, Authentication, AuthenticationProvider, AuthenticationManager,
UserDetailsService, `@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`...
It felt like too much to wrap my head around.

So I decided to **take a step back and rebuild my understanding from the ground up**.

To test and solidify what I learned, I created a series of posts explaining the core concepts — not just for myself, but
for anyone else feeling the same way.

### ✨ If you're a Java developer — whether you're a beginner or a seasoned engineer — this series is for you.

You’ll get practical insights into what actually matters when working with Spring Security — the foundational building
blocks that everything else is built on.

### 🔑 Core Concepts You Should Understand

Once you grasp these, Spring Security becomes far more predictable and less mysterious:

* **Filters**
* **SecurityFilterChain**
* **AuthenticationManager**
* **Authentication**
* **AuthenticationProvider**
* **Authority / Role**

These aren’t just buzzwords — they are core interfaces and abstractions that underpin every authentication method Spring
supports.

Whether you're working with:

* ✅ Basic Auth
* ✅ Form Login
* ✅ JWT Authentication
* ✅ OAuth2 / OIDC

…you’re building on top of these fundamental pieces.
